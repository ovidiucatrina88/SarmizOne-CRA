# Style & Formatting

- No Prettier/ESLint config is committed. Follow existing TypeScript/React conventions in each file.
- Keep imports ordered roughly by module scope (node core → packages → local relative paths) mirroring surrounding files.
- Use Tailwind utility patterns established in current components; avoid introducing alternative CSS approaches unless asked.
- Comments should be minimal and high value—describe non-obvious logic, not line-by-line narration.
- Default to ASCII characters to match the repo’s current style.
